## About alTRU.Eco
_Bottom-up_ **altruistic economy** using _open-source_ technology with _data privacy_.

### :bulb: The Idea

**The [eBay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay) of altruism.**
A Trusted _F/LOSS_ **marketplace** for _Sharing Economy_, where individuals, communities, and organizations can **share their resources, services, and needs** in a trusted way for money, in exchange for other goods and services, or like a giveaway, for free.

#### The name
Composition of "_Altruism_"¬†and "_Ecological Economy_" using¬†the emphasis on the term "_TRUE_" at the middle.

### The Work
#### The Problem
The growth in human consumption, the **waste of resources**,
 and the accelerating extinction of species
 make clear the **impossibility** of continuous growth. 
Sometimes we have to make hard decisions and think about **what is enough**.

#### The Solution
**The rules** are simple: Taking what we need and sharing what we don‚Äôt
whilst recognizing that there are limits to how much we can give and how much we can take.
#### The Gain
There are many ways that we **benefit** from giving a fair share of our abundance to others in our community.

### alTRUEco Toolkit

**`alTRUE`** is a **toolkit** to solve _Scarcity_ in _Local Communities_.Running an _alTRUE_ instance, you can create _peer-to-peer marketplaces_ for the sale, exchange, or gift of goods and services to support _Sharing Economy_.

> We are provided with _times of abundance_, which enables us to **share with others**.

### MVP

### alTRUE Ecological Economy
_Ecological Economy_ it's the **independent network** of individuals, communities, and organizations applying the practice of _Ecological Economics_.
