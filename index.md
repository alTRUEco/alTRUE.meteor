## About alTRU.Eco
**Bottom-up** **altruistic economy** using **open-source technology** with **data privacy**.

### :bulb: The Idea

**The [eBay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay) of altruism.** A **Trusted _F/LOSS_ marketplace** for *collaborative economy*, where individuals, communities and organisations able to share their *resources, services and needs* in a trusted way for *money*, in *exchange* for other goods and services, or like a *give away*, for free.

#### The name
Composition of _Altruism_ and _Ecological Economy_ with the emphasis of the term "TRUE" in the middle.

### The Work
#### The Problem
The growth in human consumption, waste of resources,
and the accelerating extinction of species
makes clear the **impossibility** of continuous growth.
Sometimes we need to make hard decisions and consider what enough is.

#### The Solution
**The rules** are simple: Taking what we need and sharing what we donâ€™t
whilst recognising that there are limits to how much we can give and how much we can take.
#### The Gain
There are many ways that we **benefit** from giving a fair share of our abundance to others in our community.

### alTRUEco Toolkit

**`#alTRUEco`** is a toolkit to solve scarcity in local communities. Running an *alTRUEco* instance you can create *peer-to-peer* marketplace for sale, exchange or gift of goods and services to support *Sharing Economy*.

_\> We are provided with **times of abundance** which enables us to **share with others**._
### MVP
Easy-to-use *F/LOSS* **resource management toolkit** with **trusted marketplace** to sell, exchange or give away goods and services in the name of altruism.

### alTRU Ecological Economy
Ecological Economy it's the independent network of individuals, communities and organisations applying the practice of Ecological Economics.
This is a sustainable model, inspired by the observation and research of small local communities in diverse locations and circumstances.
During the development we are focusing on the _Permaculture ethics and principles_, following the _The Sustainable Development Agenda_ and paying exceptional attention on _Data privacy and Transparency_.
